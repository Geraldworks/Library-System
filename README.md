# BT2102 Project 1
This project aims to recreate a simple Library Manager application using MySQL as the database and Python as the GUI (tkinter)

Users will be able to register themselves with the library manager and proceed to borrow, reserve and return books. Users can even look up available books in the system and pay fines if they have overdue books.
